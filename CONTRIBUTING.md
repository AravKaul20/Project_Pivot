- Git
- Basic knowledge of Android development, Java, and machine learning concepts

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AravKaul20/Project_Pivot.git
   cd Project_Pivot
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
   - Navigate to the cloned directory

3. **Sync dependencies**
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete
   - Ensure all dependencies are downloaded

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow [Android coding standards](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add comments for complex logic, especially in ML-related code
- Keep methods focused and concise

### Architecture
- **MainActivity.java**: Camera integration and UI management
- **OnnxModel.java**: Machine learning model wrapper
- **MediaPipePoseDetector.java**: Pose detection logic
- **PredictionSmoother.java**: Prediction stabilization

### Testing
- Test on physical devices when possible (camera functionality)
- Verify performance on different Android versions
- Test edge cases (poor lighting, multiple people, etc.)

## üìù How to Contribute

   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding guidelines
   - Add/update tests if necessary
   - Update documentation

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Describe your changes clearly
