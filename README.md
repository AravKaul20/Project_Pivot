## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Camera Feed**: Live camera preview using CameraX
- **Dual Model Inference**: Simultaneous stance and execution classification
- **Optimized Performance**: INT8-quantized ONNX models for fast inference
- **Low Latency**: ~1-2ms inference time per model
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking inference on dedicated thread
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimal interface with live prediction updates

## üì± Screenshots

The app displays:
- Full-screen camera preview
- Real-time stance classification (Correct/Incorrect + confidence)
- Real-time execution classification (Correct/Incorrect + confidence)
- Inference latency metrics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Models
- **Stance Model**: `stance_int8.onnx` (113KB, >95% accuracy)
- **Execution Model**: `execution_int8.onnx` (113KB, >95% accuracy)
- **Input**: 28 features (14 pose keypoints √ó 2 coordinates)
- **Output**: Binary classification (correct/incorrect) with confidence

### Components
- **MainActivity.java**: Camera integration, UI updates, lifecycle management
- **OnnxModel.java**: ONNX Runtime wrapper for model loading and inference
- **activity_main.xml**: UI layout with camera preview and prediction displays

### Dependencies
- ONNX Runtime Android: 1.16.0
- CameraX: 1.3.1 (Core, Camera2, Lifecycle, View)
- ConstraintLayout: 2.1.4
- AppCompat: 1.6.1

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Build

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK API 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Physical device or emulator with camera support

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone & Open Project**
   ```bash
   cd PROJECT_PIVOT
   # Open in Android Studio
   ```

2. **Sync Dependencies**
   - Open `app/build.gradle`
   - Click "Sync Now" when prompted
   - Ensure all dependencies download successfully

3. **Verify Assets**
   - Confirm `app/src/main/assets/` contains:
     - `stance_int8.onnx`
     - `execution_int8.onnx`

4. **Build APK**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   # Or use Android Studio: Build ‚Üí Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) ‚Üí Build APK(s)
   ```

5. **Install & Run**
   ```bash
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   # Or use Android Studio: Run ‚Üí Run 'app'
   ```

## üìã Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- **Camera**: For live video feed and pose detection
- Auto-granted on first launch or manually in Settings

## üéØ Usage

1. **Launch App**: Open PROJECT_PIVOT on your device
2. **Grant Permission**: Allow camera access when prompted
3. **View Predictions**: See real-time stance and execution classifications
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check inference latency in bottom panel

## üîß Technical Details

### Model Integration
- Models loaded asynchronously on app startup
- Inference runs on dedicated background thread
- UI updates dispatched to main thread
- Automatic resource cleanup on app exit

### Performance Metrics
- **Model Loading**: ~100-200ms (one-time)
- **Inference Latency**: ~1-2ms per model
- **Total Pipeline**: <5ms end-to-end
- **Memory Usage**: ~10MB (models + runtime)

### Current Implementation
The current version uses **dummy pose data** for demonstration. For production use, integrate MediaPipe or similar pose detection library to extract real keypoints from camera frames.

## üöß Future Enhancements

- [ ] **MediaPipe Integration**: Replace dummy data with real pose detection
- [ ] **Recording Mode**: Save predictions with timestamps
- [ ] **Statistics**: Track accuracy over time
- [ ] **Model Updates**: Hot-swap models without app restart
- [ ] **Multi-person**: Support multiple people in frame

## üß™ Testing

### Smoke Test
1. Install APK on device
2. Launch app ‚Üí Should show camera permission dialog
3. Grant permission ‚Üí Should show live camera feed
4. Verify predictions updating continuously
5. Check latency metrics in bottom panel

### Performance Test
1. Monitor CPU usage during inference
2. Verify smooth 30fps camera preview
3. Confirm <5ms total latency
4. Test on different device specs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not working:**
- Check permissions in device Settings
- Ensure camera is not used by another app
- Restart app or device

**Models not loading:**
- Verify ONNX files in assets folder
- Check Android Studio Build ‚Üí Clean Project
- View logcat for detailed error messages

**Performance issues:**
- Close other camera apps
- Ensure sufficient device memory
- Consider using emulator with host GPU

### Debug Commands
```bash
# View logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(MainActivity|OnnxModel)"

# Check APK contents
unzip -l app-debug.apk | grep assets

# Monitor performance
adb shell top | grep project_pivot
```

- **Execution**: 243 samples (118 correct, 125 incorrect)
- **Format**: MediaPipe pose keypoints (28 features)
- **Accuracy**: >95% validation accuracy
